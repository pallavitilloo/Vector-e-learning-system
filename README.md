# Vector : A complete e-learning system created on Django framework

This is an e-learning system called Vector. The system is built for instructors to create modules, upload files, URLs, assignments and projects for their students. 
The system also provides features to the users to create assessment based on questions that can be either added one-by-one or uploaded easily via an XLSX template. The assessments can be attempted in a time-monitored fashion where the timer goes up as per the allocated time limit. 

The system also has features to send and receive messages to multiple users and create discussion topics and participate in them. On top of this, the system uses a convenient user interface that gives options to users to collapse and expand various UI components for easy readability.
